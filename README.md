# CSCI4200 - Programming Languages

# Functional Programming Languages Assignment

All programs written by Matthew Johnston for CSCI 4200. These programs are all written in LISP to satisfy the requirements of the assignment.

To compile and run these .lisp files, I used <a href="https://clisp.sourceforge.io/">CLISP</a>.

To run these programs:
1. Download CLISP
2. Install CLISP
3. Open a Command Prompt/Terminal
4. Within the Command Prompt/Terminal, navigate to the directory where the .lisp files are saved.
5. Use the command "clisp program.lisp" to run it (where "program" is the name of the program.)
6. Done
